# ai_licia Integrations

Welcome to the **ai_licia Integrations Repository**! This is an open and collaborative space for sharing custom scripts and integrations that enhance the functionality of [ai_licia](https://www.getailicia.com/). Whether you're creating custom scripts for Streamer.bot, Lumia, or any other tool, platform, or game that interacts with our [public API](https://docs.getailicia.com/), this is the place to share your work and explore contributions from others.

## Getting Started

To get started, check out the examples already available in this repository. These scripts and integrations are designed to be:
- **Easy to Use**: Accessible for users with little to no development experience.
- **Customizable**: Adaptable to fit your unique needs and preferences.
- **Collaborative**: Open for feedback, improvements, and new ideas.

Explore the possibilities with ai_licia's [public API documentation](https://docs.getailicia.com/) for details on how to integrate with our platform.
