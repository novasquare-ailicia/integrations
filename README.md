# ai_licia Integrations

Welcome to the **ai_licia Integrations Repository**! This is an open and collaborative space for sharing custom scripts and integrations that enhance the functionality of [ai_licia](https://www.getailicia.com/). Whether you're creating custom scripts for Streamer.bot, Lumia, or any other tool, platform, or game that interacts with our [public API](https://docs.getailicia.com/), this is the place to share your work and explore contributions from others.

## Getting Started

To get started, check out the examples already available in this repository. These scripts and integrations are designed to be:
- **Easy to Use**: Accessible for users with little to no development experience.
- **Customizable**: Adaptable to fit your unique needs and preferences.
- **Collaborative**: Open for feedback, improvements, and new ideas.

Explore the possibilities with ai_licia's [public API documentation](https://docs.getailicia.com/) for details on how to integrate with our platform.


## Usage Guidelines and Best Practices

### Running Scripts

ai_licia scripts are written in **JavaScript** and require an environment to execute. Here are some recommended tools:

#### Streamer.bot
- **Integration**: Streamer.bot is a popular platform for automating streaming workflows and supports both JavaScript and Python scripts.
- **Setup**:
    1. Create an action for the event.
    2. Choose the Trigger (recommended is Twitch -> Channel Reward -> Reward Redemption).
    3. Create a Sub-Action: Core -> System -> Run a Program.
        - **Target**: `pythonw.exe`
        - **Working Directory**: The folder containing the script.
        - **Arguments**: The name of the script followed by Streamer.bot variables, formatted as: `"%variableName%" "%variableName2%"`.
    4. Click OK and run the Action whichever way you decided!
#### Tampermonkey
- **Integration**: Tampermonkey is a browser extension that allows you to run custom JavaScript scripts on specific web pages.
- **Setup**:
    1. Install the [Tampermonkey extension](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for your browser.
    2. Create a new script and paste your JavaScript code.
    3. Define the metadata (e.g., `@match` URLs) to specify where the script should run.
